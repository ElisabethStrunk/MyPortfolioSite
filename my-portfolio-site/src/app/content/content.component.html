          Hi! I am Elisabeth.<br>
          I am a software engineer passionate about embedded and web back end software development.
          I love working on projects that are in-teresting and challenging and require using
          technologies, APIs and packages I have never worked with before. To give me the perfect
          environment, combine Scrum and a positive, playful atmosphere with highly motivated team
          members, who love their work and are willing to share their expertise.

        I developed a full stack web application with <b>Python/Flask</b> that provides a list of
        sports items within a variety of categories. The items are managed in an <b>SQLite</b> database.
        The application also provides a user authentication system utilizing Google sign-in as
        well as Facebook sign-in. Signed-in users can add, edit and delete items.

        This project I did during my time with <a href="https://salt-and-pepper.eu/en/software-solutions/" target="_blank">SALT AND PEPPER Software GmbH & Co. KG</a>, Hamburg.
        <br>
        Bringing together 7 co-workers from different departments in a Friday afternoon project, we
        developed a RaspberryPi-controlled robot using <b>Python</b> (RPi.GPIO and Flask) for a student internship.
        The robot is manually controllable by mobile app via WiFi.
        <br>
        We design the software in its most simple way so students aged 13-16 years would be able to
        understand the code. We presented the project with missing code sections to a 13 year old student intern,
        who had lots of fun bringing the SoSo Bot back to life.

        I developed a modular embedded controller software written in <b>C++</b> as a basis for an
        autonomous car-like robot. The aim was to design a base software and implement it on the
        existing hardware to lay the foundation for future student projects on this particular model car.
        The software architecture I designed is based on software modules that can be handled independently.
        <br>
        Existing code was used to implement software modules for the communication with the robotâ€™s sensors
        and actuators. Furthermore, software modules for a PID velocity controller, a yaw angle controller
        and a simple motion profile generator for point-to-point movement were developed from scratch,
        including the design and parameterization of the controllers.
        <br>
        For the work I did on this project I was awarded the <a href="https://www.vde-suedbayern.de/de/ueber-uns/preise-ehrungen/vde-award/muenchener-abend-2018" target="_blank">VDE Award 2018</a>.

        I did this project together with two friends for the "Laboratory for Microcontroller Technology"
        at the <a href="https://www.th-rosenheim.de/" target="_blank">University Of Applied Sciences Rosenheim</a>.
        <br>
        The aim of the project was to improve the position and motion estimation for a rolling ball on a
        two-axle traversable platform with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter" target="_blank">Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)</a>.
        <br>
        We first simulated the state estimation by EKF with real measurement data in <b>MATLAB</b>, then
        implemented it in <b>C</b> code, integrated it into an existing controller program and deployed it on a
        32-bit microcontroller for real-time execution with the real system.
        <br>
        With our algorithm implemented there was an observable increase in the velocity and accuracy of
        the controller.
